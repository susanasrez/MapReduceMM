# Matrix Multiplication Repository and Frequent-item-set Algorithm with MapReduce

<img src="https://github.com/susanasrez/JavaSearchEngineProject/blob/master/logo.png" width="150" align="left" />

This repository is designed to perform matrix multiplication and implementation of the Frequent-item-set algorithm using the MapReduce framework. The code is organised in three main branches:

- **"Main"** branch: contains the Python code that performs matrix multiplication using the mrjob library.

- **"Java"** branch: Contains the Java code that performs array multiplication using Hadoop's Maven dependency.

- **"Itemset"** branch: Here is the code of the implementation of the Frequent-item-set algorithm using MapReduce in Java.

This repository provides examples of MapReduce applications in two different domains: matrix processing and data mining. Each branch offers a specific solution for its respective task. In addition, the repository also includes a paper discussing results and additional information related to the MapReduce implementations and applications presented here.
Feel free to explore and use the code in each of the branches according to your needs!
